## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment

### DevOps Cycle

The DevOps Cycle is a continuous process, represented by the following stages in a clockwise flow, with feedback loops:

1.  **PLAN**
    *   Icon: Checklist/Document
    *   Flows to: **CODE**

2.  **CODE**
    *   Icon: `< />` (Code Brackets)
    *   Flows to: **MONITOR**

3.  **MONITOR**
    *   Icon: Server Rack/Building
    *   Flows to: **BUILD**
    *   Feedback Loop: An arrow indicates that MONITOR can feed back to **CODE**.

4.  **BUILD**
    *   Icon: Gears/Cogwheels
    *   Flows to: **TEST**

5.  **TEST**
    *   Icon: Magnifying Glass/Bug
    *   Flows to: **RELEASE**

6.  **RELEASE**
    *   Icon: Cloud/Deployment Symbol
    *   Flows to: **PLAN** (Completing the cycle).
    *   *Note: The diagram also shows "RELEISE" (likely a typo for RELEASE) with an arrow pointing to **PLAN**, reinforcing the continuous nature of the cycle.*
